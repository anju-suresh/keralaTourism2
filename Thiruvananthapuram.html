        <h1>Thiruvananthapuram</h1>
        <div class="contain">
            <p>The capital city of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum is an appealing blend of a strongly rooted heritage and a nostalgic colonial legacy. Built upon seven hills, this city has long since left the days when it was only used by seafaring explorers behind - today, Trivandrum is a swanky metropolis with quaint urban charm and plenty of scenic places to visit. Proudly retaining its age-old cultural charm, Trivandrum offers a huge variety of sights including incredible museums, beautifully designed palaces, sacred temples and mesmerizing beaches, making the city one of the best tourist spots in South India.
            </p>
            <p>The Padmanabhaswamy temple (also known as Anantha Padmanabhaswamy temple), is a must-visit temple of India. Located in the heart of the city, the temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, and stands out for its striking mix of Keralan and Dravidian style architecture, showcasing a sublime artistic temperament. The 18-feet high idol of Lord Vishnu is awe-inspiring, and tourists throng this temple all year round to seek the blessings of and pay their respects to Lord Vishnu. Other famous temples in Trivandrum include the Attukal Bhagawati temple, the Aazhimala Siva Temple, the Karikkakom Chamundi Devi Temple, and the Pazhavangadi Ganapathy Temple.</p>
