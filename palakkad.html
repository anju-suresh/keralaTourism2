        <h1>Palakkad</h1>
        <div class="contain">
            <p>The quaint town of Palakkad in central Kerala boasts of picturesque landscape, tranquil scenery and clear backwaters. Also known as Palghat, Pallakad is located near a wide low pass in the Western Ghats mountain ranges. Palakkad is the land of Palmyras and Paddy Fields and is famous as the chief granary of Kerala</p>
            <p>Palakkad gets its name from pala trees which once dominated the area. This is the area which links Kerala to Tamil Nadu and perhaps does so in a cultural sense too, since the language spoken in the villages here is Tamil, unlike the rest of the state where Malayalam is prevalent. </p>
            <p>Palakkad is known for the ruins of Tipu Sulthan's Fort, four dams and one of the first amusement parks of Kerala - Fantasy Park. Some other locations that can be visited in the area include the Palakkad Fort, Silent Valley National Park, Pothundy Dam, Jain Temple, Dhoni waterfalls, Walayar Dam etc.</p>
